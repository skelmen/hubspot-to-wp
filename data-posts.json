Basic Geo-targeting delivers digital advertising to consumers in specific locations. Generally these are campaigns and ad units targeted to people living in certain cities or neighborhoods. Perhaps a certain zip code. Geo-Fencing takes this concept a step further.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Geo-Fencing Made Simple</strong></p>\n<p>Modern smartphones collect and distribute data about us constantly. One of the most valuable pieces of data to marketers is the exact location of a given target customer. Location can indicate interest more than other types of data. Modern smartphones provide extremely accurate GPS functions. In-turn, this data becomes available to marketers like us in real time.</p>\n<p>For instance, if your store sells mattresses it would make sense to target consumers that are visiting or have visited stores that also sell mattresses. Geo-Fencing makes this possible and can help local businesses win more customers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2430639/Screen%20Shot%202018-03-13%20at%201.02.55%20PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2018-03-13 at 1.02.55 PM.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 282px;\" class=\"\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Components Of A Successful Geo-Fencing Campaign</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Targeting Zone:</strong> This is the location you want to target. You want to deliver your advertising message to people that are either currently visiting or have recently visited this location. The Target Zone can be a specific address or multiple addresses.</li>\n<li><strong>The Message:</strong> This is your offer or the advertising unit you want to deliver to people in the target zone.</li>\n<li><strong>The Conversion Zone:</strong> This is the where you measure the effectiveness of this campaign. When a person that has been in the target zone is delivered your message and then visits your store this is a conversion. Like the Target Zone, the Conversion Zone can be an exact address, multiple addresses or any location specified on a map.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Pitfalls Of Geo-Fencing Campaigns</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Relying On Singular Tactics:</strong> Geo-Fencing is an excellent tactic to incorporate into an overall campaign strategy. However, Geo-Fencing shouldn’t be the only tactic employed. Search retargeting, site retargeting, a strong social media strategy and other tactics should be included in any successful campaign.</li>\n<li><strong>Poor Technology Partners:</strong> Geo-Fencing is a hot topic right now. However, many providers haven’t invested in high quality technology platforms that allow truly address specific targeting.</li>\n<li><strong>Poor Creative Messaging:</strong> Your creative is also important. Consumers have short attention spans and you’re competing with multiple advertising messages. Your creative must be on point and relevant.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ready to use this tactic in your digital advertising approach?

One of the most valuable pieces of data to marketers is the exact location of a given target customer. Location can indicate interest more than other types of data. Modern smartphones provide extremely accurate GPS functions. In-turn, this data becomes available to marketers like us in real time.</p>\n<p>For instance, if your store sells mattresses it would make sense to target consumers that are visiting or have visited stores that also sell mattresses. Geo-Fencing makes this possible and can help local businesses win more customers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2430639/Screen%20Shot%202018-03-13%20at%201.02.55%20PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2018-03-13 at 1.02.55 PM.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 282px;\" class=\"\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Components Of A Successful Geo-Fencing Campaign</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Targeting Zone:</strong> This is the location you want to target. You want to deliver your advertising message to people that are either currently visiting or have recently visited this location. The Target Zone can be a specific address or multiple addresses.</li>\n<li><strong>The Message:</strong> This is your offer or the advertising unit you want to deliver to people in the target zone.</li>\n<li><strong>The Conversion Zone:</strong> This is the where you measure the effectiveness of this campaign. When a person that has been in the target zone is delivered your message and then visits your store this is a conversion. Like the Target Zone, the Conversion Zone can be an exact address, multiple addresses or any location specified on a map.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Pitfalls Of Geo-Fencing Campaigns</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Relying On Singular Tactics:</strong> Geo-Fencing is an excellent tactic to incorporate into an overall campaign strategy. However, Geo-Fencing shouldn’t be the only tactic employed. Search retargeting, site retargeting, a strong social media strategy and other tactics should be included in any successful campaign.</li>\n<li><strong>Poor Technology Partners:</strong> Geo-Fencing is a hot topic right now. However, many providers haven’t invested in high quality technology platforms that allow truly address specific targeting.</li>\n<li><strong>Poor Creative Messaging:</strong> Your creative is also important. Consumers have short attention spans and you’re competing with multiple advertising messages. Your creative must be on point and relevant.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ready to use this tactic in your digital advertising approach?

Not only are we a Google Partner and team of digital experts, but also we offer all the services of a full-service advertising firm. Whether you are an ADM agency client or not, we can help you select the right promotional product for next meeting, trade show, event, chamber ribbon cutting or product launch!</span></p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>Our firm can work with your budget and provide solid recommendations, as well as provide samples to take the guesswork out of the decision. With years of experience in event marketing, we know what works! We can also help design table displays, logo tablecloths, retractable banners, brochures, business cards and more for you! So, don’t wait until right before your next event – plan for the long-term and make sure your event presence stands above the competition.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Here are a couple tips to keep in mind when narrowing down your options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Think About the Event.</strong><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\"> Is the event a trade show? Conference tote bags would be a great solution! With so much paperwork given out at these events, bags are very valuable and have a great shelf life during and after the event.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2430639/Screen%20Shot%202018-03-14%20at%2010.03.57%20AM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2018-03-14 at 10.03.57 AM.png\" width=\"267\" height=\"274\" class=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><br>2.&nbsp;<strong>Think About the End User.</strong> Know your customer. Think about their typical demographics – male or female? Middle or higher income? Their industry/business? Their interests? Once you narrow down the specifics about your current and target customers, your promo product decision gets much easier. Busy on the go, but never without your phone? Then the adhesive mobile phone wallets help hold what's valuable right on the back of your phone! Interested in a healthy lifestyle? Then these fruit-infused tumblers make a great fit!<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2430639/Screen%20Shot%202018-03-14%20at%2010.04.55%20AM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2018-03-14 at 10.04.55 AM.png\" width=\"252\" style=\"width: 252px;\" class=\"\"><img src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2430639/Screen%20Shot%202018-03-22%20at%203.43.51%20PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2018-03-22 at 3.43.51 PM.png\" width=\"162\" style=\"width: 162px; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; float: left;\" class=\"\"></p>\n<p>3.&nbsp;<strong>Think Long Term.</strong> When selecting your item, what would be something the user would find beneficial to say, keep on their desk at work? Or, maybe a cap or apparel, which is a higher investment, but can be seen years after the customer or prospect received it. You want to keep your company/your brand top-of-mind, so what promo product fits that need. This mood coloring changing cup would certainly stay on my desk to keep me hydrated AND entertained!<br><img src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2430639/Screen%20Shot%202018-03-22%20at%203.44.32%20PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2018-03-22 at 3.44.32 PM.png\" width=\"253\" style=\"width: 253px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"\">4.&nbsp;<strong>Think Handy and Useful!</strong> No one wants to waste precious marketing dollars on an item that is just going in the wastebasket. So think of items that will be of use – thumb drives, a heavy/metal pen, magnetic clip for the fridge. Also don’t be too scared to do something a little fun. We think these handy highlighters are quite attention grabbing! Also, in the fun category and useful - a figet spinner pen!<br>&nbsp;<img src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2430639/Screen%20Shot%202018-03-22%20at%203.43.11%20PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2018-03-22 at 3.43.11 PM.png\" width=\"236\" style=\"width: 236px;\" class=\"\"><img src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2430639/Screen%20Shot%202018-03-22%20at%203.46.12%20PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2018-03-22 at 3.46.12 PM.png\" width=\"272\" style=\"width: 272px;\" class=\"\"></p>\n<p>5.&nbsp;<strong>Think Ahead.</strong> Most promo items we order take one to two weeks to arrive. Some custom items might take longer, so make sure you start early so you don’t encounter rush fees for printing and or shipping!&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">With the thousands of products out there, you need the right team working for you and providing solid recommendations that don’t break the bank, but break through the clutter.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Many local tradeshows and events are just around the corner, so now is the time to get those orders placed. The more lead-time we receive, the more vendor outlets we can investigate to get you even better deals!

We have proven to our valuable customers that our digital foresight and our complete, full service agency offerings are moving the needle and driving results. Our team shares this win with our customers,” said Jason Holmes, President and Co-Founder of Affect Digital Media. For Best Digital Agency, judges’ comments said, “an impressive array of products and competencies.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">“This is a highly competitive contest that recognizes the best of local media when it comes to digital innovation,” said Nancy Lane, President, Local Media Association.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">“ADM continues to break the mold in terms of product offerings and the high quality of service they provide to their customers, serving as true media consultants with the client’s best interests at the core of what they recommend. I couldn’t be more proud of this incredible team of specialists,” said Dan Easton, CEO and Co-Founder of Affect Digital Media.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">For the Best Native/Sponsored Content Campaign, ADM entered their Brandsense native advertising campaign done for Jackson County Hospital District. Judges shared, “The synergy with the hospital’s brand and the outreach goal of the ad campaign is spot-on. Metrics are very encouraging as well. The campaign really underscores the importance of a health leader in a community.”</span></p>\n<p>In the Best New Digital Initiative category, judges shared in reference to ADM’s entry of AgencyQue, a custom-developed project management software, “Affect Digital Media made a strong first impression on the judges by explaining the process through which they decided on building AgencyQue, a project management system: they saw the need from their customers and saw the lack of efficient product in the market. They had a very sustainable growth plan for the platform they built, actually finding a market for it.”</p>\n<p><strong>Ready to get started?</strong><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.affectdigital.com/contact/\" target=\"_blank\">Work with ADM today</a><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

You can see them coming.</p>\n<p>Traditional media reps with the latest wiz bang marketing&nbsp;technology or trend made popular&nbsp;by a silicon valley startup last year. The process is so predictable that you can set your watch by it. Fresh out of planning meetings and training programs designed to reverse their inevitable slide these poor folks are given the directive to \"sell the Internet...\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Some Background</strong></p>\n<p>All traditional media - Newspapers, Local TV stations and Radio stations are under assault&nbsp;from digital competitors at every level.</p>\n<p>Google, Facebook and the entire digital ecosystem&nbsp;have rendered&nbsp;these traditional media companies nearly irrelevant&nbsp;when it comes to reaching the valuable demographics embodied&nbsp;in Baby Boomers, Generation X&nbsp;and especially Millennials. The slide in audience has been horrific and irreversible.</p>\n<p>This is a classic case of not understanding what business you're in. Newspapers, radio and TV stations have historically believed&nbsp;that they were in the business of selling \"space\" and \"distribution.\" Unfortunately, this is similar to the mistake made by buggy whip manufacturers at the turn of the last century. Whip manufacturers were actually in the business of making the vehicle go faster not whipping horses. Likewise, media companies used to be in the business of improving the bottom line of their customers. That business model has slowely transformed into something more self serving.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What To Do?</strong></p>\n<p>As these bussiness&nbsp;lines have deteriorated and the audience has shifted to non centralized digital platforms disrupted media companies have increasingly started to play a game of <strong>\"me too.\"</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Every year there is a new gimmick. Unfortunately, the products and services offered to local businesses by these organizations are generally poorly executed, ineffective and outsourced. The product lineup and business plan is designed to help the media company slow an inevitable&nbsp;revenue slide rather than help your business grow and truly&nbsp;reach new audiences.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

                        "value": "<p>Once again, Facebook will be making another very large, important update in the coming months. Mark Zuckerburg recently announced that they will be cleaning up the newsfeed to include more content from friends and family as well as important news and updates that spark conversation. This means that they will be limiting public content, including videos, from publishers and business pages.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>So what does this mean for marketers?</strong></p>\n<p>Basically, if you have a following of 5,000, you generally reach maybe 100 - 300 on average organically, give or take. We all know it’s a small percentage, between 3% - 6%. With this new change, organic reach may drop to half of that! They also stated that during the update<span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">, reach and traffic will decrease varying from page to page. This will be impacted by type of content and how people interact with it.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>No more clickbait</strong></p>\n<p>Pages that post \"clickbait articles\" and \"engagement-bait” posts will be highly affected. For example, the grid of pictures asking you to select a reaction or a contest asking you to like, share and comment to win. Pages that use these types of “baiting” will see negative impacts on their reach and page and may even see drops after they have stopped. Facebook views these as meaningless engagement interactions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.affectdigital.com/services/social-media/\"><img src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2430639/combo1.png\" alt=\"combo1.png\" class=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Quality over Quantity</strong><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>What they say they really want to see is <a href=\"https://www.affectdigital.com/services/social-media/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>meaningful interactions</strong></a> so quality over quantity will be key. So much so that if you don’t have good content, it would actually be better not to post. Especially since pages that over-post will also be dinged by Facebook. Posting 30 times a day will not help reach people in the newsfeed, it will only hurt your page.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What about Instagram?</strong></p>\n<p>Since Instagram is a part of Facebook and has followed suit with algorithm changes in the past, this change will most likely happen there in the future as well so be prepared.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What Facebook Likes Most: Profits</strong></p>\n<p>Most importantly, Facebook will be even more of a pay-to-play environment. Organic is what’s going to be affected by this change not advertising.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.affectdigital.com/services/social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2430639/bigstock-CHIANGMAI-THAILAND-April---146288360.jpg\" alt=\"bigstock-CHIANGMAI-THAILAND-April---146288360.jpg\" class=\"\" width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px;\"></a>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>So what can my business do?</strong></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Set Social Goals.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Make sure you know what you are trying accomplish on Facebook, especially now that campaigns are going to be even more important.

While there is generally a lull in shopping activity, consumer spending will begin to heat up in just a few short weeks. People tend to buy living room furniture, particularly recliners leading up to the Super Bowl and shortly after the big game Valentines Day gift giving will be in full swing. As a marketer, there isn’t much time off!</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>Now is a good time to tweak your approach and improve your local digital marketing plan. Following these 5 simple steps will have you well on your way:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Evaluate Your Business Presence</strong></p>\n<p>This means your website, social network profiles, and business directory listings. Is the basic information accurate? Business hours, addresses, website links, specials, etc. With this region growing so fast there are literally thousands of people new to the area. The Internet is the number one source for information when relocating.</p>\n<p>Repeat step one on a mobile device. This can be eye opening. If you consider that more than 60% of search engine traffic is now mobile and that more than 50% of that traffic has local intent – local people are searching for local businesses, products, and services. Are you ready to delight these potential customers?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Evaluate Your Competition </strong></p>\n<p>Evaluate your competition from the viewpoint of a consumer online. If you’re competing with national companies or large regional players it may seem daunting to take that fight online. What are your advantages over big box stores.? You likely highlight these advantages to your customer base everyday in your store or in your marketing message. Are you getting that message out through digital means?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Educate</strong></p>\n<p>Educate yourself. Find local digital marketing experts and ask them tough questions. If they’re asking you to spend money with them then there are no dumb questions in the realm of digital advertising. Ask questions until you have a working understanding of what you’re buying.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Implement</strong></p>\n<p>Develop your strategy. Who is your target market? What tactics may work best to reach them? Work with your trusted expert to develop and implement your campaign.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5: Optimize</strong></p>\n<p>Make sure you understand your reporting and then optimize your campaigns accordingly. Are your paid search campaigns and targeted display campaigns converting well? Are you getting buyers to your website across desktop, tablets, and smartphones?</p>\n<p>Of course, this isn’t an exhaustive list. However, by following these simple steps and learning along the way you’ll be well ahead of other local businesses!</p>",

Is the basic information accurate? Business hours, addresses, website links, specials, etc. With this region growing so fast there are literally thousands of people new to the area. The Internet is the number one source for information when relocating.</p>\n<p>Repeat step one on a mobile device. This can be eye opening. If you consider that more than 60% of search engine traffic is now mobile and that more than 50% of that traffic has local intent – local people are searching for local businesses, products, and services. Are you ready to delight these potential customers?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Evaluate Your Competition </strong></p>\n<p>Evaluate your competition from the viewpoint of a consumer online. If you’re competing with national companies or large regional players it may seem daunting to take that fight online. What are your advantages over big box stores.? You likely highlight these advantages to your customer base everyday in your store or in your marketing message. Are you getting that message out through digital means?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Educate</strong></p>\n<p>Educate yourself. Find local digital marketing experts and ask them tough questions. If they’re asking you to spend money with them then there are no dumb questions in the realm of digital advertising. Ask questions until you have a working understanding of what you’re buying.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Implement</strong></p>\n<p>Develop your strategy. Who is your target market? What tactics may work best to reach them? Work with your trusted expert to develop and implement your campaign.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5: Optimize</strong></p>\n<p>Make sure you understand your reporting and then optimize your campaigns accordingly. Are your paid search campaigns and targeted display campaigns converting well? Are you getting buyers to your website across desktop, tablets, and smartphones?</p>\n<p>Of course, this isn’t an exhaustive list. However, by following these simple steps and learning along the way you’ll be well ahead of other local businesses!</p>",

While there is generally a lull in shopping activity, consumer spending will begin to heat up in just a few short weeks. People tend to buy living room furniture, particularly recliners leading up to the Super Bowl and shortly after the big game Valentines Day gift giving will be in full swing. As a marketer, there isn’t much time off!</p>\n",

Over 30 business professionals attended and we don’t think it was just for the free lunch (although a pepperoni Pizza King would be reason enough!) </p><p></p><p>What these professionals were hoping to get from this <em>lunch &amp; learn</em> were tips on how to market their business in this digital age; specifically, how to harness the power of the 800-pound gorilla that is Google. Here is a synopsis of what we learned during the live-streamed webinar from Mountain View, California:</p><p></p><p><strong>Buyers are No Longer Delaying Purchases</strong></p><p></p><p>The days of walking aimlessly from store-to-store in the local shopping center are over. How many times have you yourself researched a product or service online before handing over your hard-earned cash to someone behind a counter? It happens with most purchases these days. Google provided some very interesting stats that opened more that a few eyes in the darkened room on Wednesday.</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>84% of “near me” searches on Google happen on a smartphone. That means that people are looking for stores nearby while they are out-and-about.</li><li>3 out of every 4 local searches from a mobile device will result in visit to a local store within 24 hours.</li><li>One-quarter of those visits will result in a purchase.</li><li>Even though ecommerce is very popular with shoppers, 85% of all transactions still happen at the local retailer.</li></ul><p></p><p>There has been a 53% decrease in store foot traffic over the past several years. However, the value of each store visit has doubled because shoppers have done their homework before visiting the store! Given these facts, it is imperative that businesses engage with these smartphone users. If your website, SEO, and/or Google listing aren’t optimized for mobile searches, you are losing the sale.</p><p></p><p><strong>One Minute and Ten Seconds</strong></p><p></p><p>Another interesting stat from the workshop is that the typical mobile session happens within one minute and ten seconds. That means that a business website must be able to get a visitor from the moment they visit the web to complete a transaction, be it an online shopping cart or filling out a form for lead generation, in about the amount of time it takes to microwave a burrito. <em>Speed is the new SEO!</em></p><p></p><p><strong>How Smart Businesses Compete</strong></p><p></p><p>People are checking their smartphones 150 times per day, therefore you must stand out when these people are comparing your business with your competitors online. Here’s how to do just that:</p><p></p><p></p><ol><li>Have a compelling website. Make sure that it is updated to work on all screens. A “responsive designed” site will allow people on their mobile devices to be able to utilize your website just as easily as those dinosaurs on their desktop computers.</li><li>Create a free business listing on Google. It will often be the first thing that comes up in a Google search when people search for your business. With a validated free business listing, the business owner gets full control over the information, such as address, phone, website link, hours of operation, photos, responding to reviews, and more.</li><li>Get free organic results on a Google search by making sure that your site has undergone “Search Engine Optimization” or SEO. Make use of important keywords on your site that people would use when searching for your product or service. Don’t forget to include your location, since many people use the term “near me” in their mobile searches.</li><li>Make use of Google AdWords to show up in a paid placement at the top of search results. Bidding on keywords that you and your competitors use will give your business an advantage. Use keywords that define a “micro-moment” - a few words that someone would use when trying to solve an immediate problem or need. As an added bonus, AdWords is “Pay Per Click” marketing so you only pay for the advertising when someone clicks on the ad.</li><li>Find a Google Partner. There are several local Google Partners in each community who work closely with Google in helping SMBs in their cities. Don’t be overwhelmed by all there is to know. Take advantage of the knowledge and experience of a valid Google Partner.</li></ol><p></p><p></p><p>As a Google Partner, we at Advocate Digital Media are here to help local small and medium-sized businesses with their marketing. ADM plans to have more of these Google workshops in the future and we would be very interested in seeing even more businesses participate. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p>",

Over 30 business professionals attended and we don’t think it was just for the free lunch (although a pepperoni Pizza King would be reason enough!) </p><p></p><p>What these professionals were hoping to get from this <em>lunch &amp; learn</em> were tips on how to market their business in this digital age; specifically, how to harness the power of the 800-pound gorilla that is Google. Here is a synopsis of what we learned during the live-streamed webinar from Mountain View, California:</p><p></p><p><strong>Buyers are No Longer Delaying Purchases</strong></p><p></p><p>The days of walking aimlessly from store-to-store in the local shopping center are over. How many times have you yourself researched a product or service online before handing over your hard-earned cash to someone behind a counter? It happens with most purchases these days. Google provided some very interesting stats that opened more that a few eyes in the darkened room on Wednesday.</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>84% of “near me” searches on Google happen on a smartphone. That means that people are looking for stores nearby while they are out-and-about.</li><li>3 out of every 4 local searches from a mobile device will result in visit to a local store within 24 hours.</li><li>One-quarter of those visits will result in a purchase.</li><li>Even though ecommerce is very popular with shoppers, 85% of all transactions still happen at the local retailer.</li></ul><p></p><p>There has been a 53% decrease in store foot traffic over the past several years. However, the value of each store visit has doubled because shoppers have done their homework before visiting the store! Given these facts, it is imperative that businesses engage with these smartphone users. If your website, SEO, and/or Google listing aren’t optimized for mobile searches, you are losing the sale.</p><p></p><p><strong>One Minute and Ten Seconds</strong></p><p></p><p>Another interesting stat from the workshop is that the typical mobile session happens within one minute and ten seconds. That means that a business website must be able to get a visitor from the moment they visit the web to complete a transaction, be it an online shopping cart or filling out a form for lead generation, in about the amount of time it takes to microwave a burrito. <em>Speed is the new SEO!</em></p><p></p><p><strong>How Smart Businesses Compete</strong></p><p></p><p>People are checking their smartphones 150 times per day, therefore you must stand out when these people are comparing your business with your competitors online. Here’s how to do just that:</p><p></p><p></p><ol><li>Have a compelling website. Make sure that it is updated to work on all screens. A “responsive designed” site will allow people on their mobile devices to be able to utilize your website just as easily as those dinosaurs on their desktop computers.</li><li>Create a free business listing on Google. It will often be the first thing that comes up in a Google search when people search for your business. With a validated free business listing, the business owner gets full control over the information, such as address, phone, website link, hours of operation, photos, responding to reviews, and more.</li><li>Get free organic results on a Google search by making sure that your site has undergone “Search Engine Optimization” or SEO. Make use of important keywords on your site that people would use when searching for your product or service. Don’t forget to include your location, since many people use the term “near me” in their mobile searches.</li><li>Make use of Google AdWords to show up in a paid placement at the top of search results. Bidding on keywords that you and your competitors use will give your business an advantage. Use keywords that define a “micro-moment” - a few words that someone would use when trying to solve an immediate problem or need. As an added bonus, AdWords is “Pay Per Click” marketing so you only pay for the advertising when someone clicks on the ad.</li><li>Find a Google Partner. There are several local Google Partners in each community who work closely with Google in helping SMBs in their cities. Don’t be overwhelmed by all there is to know. Take advantage of the knowledge and experience of a valid Google Partner.</li></ol><p></p><p></p><p>As a Google Partner, we at Advocate Digital Media are here to help local small and medium-sized businesses with their marketing.

Here’s how to do just that:</p><p></p><p></p><ol><li>Have a compelling website. Make sure that it is updated to work on all screens. A “responsive designed” site will allow people on their mobile devices to be able to utilize your website just as easily as those dinosaurs on their desktop computers.</li><li>Create a free business listing on Google. It will often be the first thing that comes up in a Google search when people search for your business. With a validated free business listing, the business owner gets full control over the information, such as address, phone, website link, hours of operation, photos, responding to reviews, and more.</li><li>Get free organic results on a Google search by making sure that your site has undergone “Search Engine Optimization” or SEO. Make use of important keywords on your site that people would use when searching for your product or service. Don’t forget to include your location, since many people use the term “near me” in their mobile searches.</li><li>Make use of Google AdWords to show up in a paid placement at the top of search results. Bidding on keywords that you and your competitors use will give your business an advantage. Use keywords that define a “micro-moment” - a few words that someone would use when trying to solve an immediate problem or need. As an added bonus, AdWords is “Pay Per Click” marketing so you only pay for the advertising when someone clicks on the ad.</li><li>Find a Google Partner. There are several local Google Partners in each community who work closely with Google in helping SMBs in their cities. Don’t be overwhelmed by all there is to know. Take advantage of the knowledge and experience of a valid Google Partner.</li></ol><p></p><p></p><p>As a Google Partner, we at Advocate Digital Media are here to help local small and medium-sized businesses with their marketing. ADM plans to have more of these Google workshops in the future and we would be very interested in seeing even more businesses participate. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p>",

Digital solutions such as targeted display advertising, remarketing, social media management, contesting, inbound lead generation and a host of other digital options are capturing former Yellow Page dollars in droves. And for good reason – these tactics work!</p>\n<p>So how do you, the business owner, start to recoup your advertising investment? The first step is to educate yourself. The following steps are a good guide:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What modern advertising techniques are truly working and supplanting yellow page adverting?</li>\n<li>Learn more about your own customers. Who are they? Why do they buy from me? How often? How can I better support their needs?</li>\n<li>Once you’ve identified your current customers you need to think about how you can reach more people like them.</li>\n<li>Work with digital marketing experts to grow your customer base. Partner with someone that will teach you as much or as little as you’d like to learn.</li>\n<li>Avoid unscrupulous marketing and media companies rely on uneducated customers that don’t understand digital or what they are selling. Our team always recommends that you understand what you’re spending your budget on. You don’t need to be an expert but you should have a general understanding of digital tactics.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you’re a current yellow pages customer you’ve likely been pitched on their digital solutions. A word of caution here. Yellow Page companies are shifting to digital, while bundling their print products with cookie cutter digital campaigns. They bundle Google Ad Words, Display, reputation management and other “buzzword compliant” digital advertising methods with their ineffective print products in order to hit a quota. It hasn’t been working. In 2011 Dex and SuperMedia had to <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-03-18/dex-supermedia-file-for-bankruptcy-to-complete-merger\">file bankruptcy</a> in order to complete their merger. But the troubles don’t end there for yellow page companies. Just last month Hibu, a UK yellow page company that operates here in the U.S., <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIrYm9uu7OAhWJ2yYKHTuwA8AQFggmMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fyellow-pages-publisher-hibu-files-u-s-bankruptcy-case-1470422933&amp;usg=AFQjCNG7bb3dpyMiDq_9AzndOGsVuKDVwQ&amp;sig2=LgjaKxNJz4t9IEiRhVgTTQ&amp;bvm=bv.131286987,d.eWE\">filed for bankruptcy</a> protection for the second time in two years.</p>\n<p>We’ve worked directly with hundreds of customers and former customers of these massive legacy yellow page companies. Over that time we’ve learned that high pressure <a href=\"http://www.tbse.com/check-your-yellow-pages-listing-agreement-immediately/\">sales tactics</a> and subpar, intentionally confusing products are at alive and well. We’re here to help.</p>",

Despite the disconnect, actual value vs. cost, yellow page companies are still raking in billions of dollars per year – particularly in local markets – from small and media sized businesses that are either afraid not to be listed or just don’t know any better.</p>\n<!--more--><p>However, many businesses of all sizes are finally <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kernlewis/2011/03/28/should-small-businesses-still-book-yellow-page-ads/#6f96cbf031a0\">putting those dollars to better use</a>. Digital solutions such as targeted display advertising, remarketing, social media management, contesting, inbound lead generation and a host of other digital options are capturing former Yellow Page dollars in droves. And for good reason – these tactics work!</p>\n<p>So how do you, the business owner, start to recoup your advertising investment? The first step is to educate yourself. The following steps are a good guide:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What modern advertising techniques are truly working and supplanting yellow page adverting?</li>\n<li>Learn more about your own customers. Who are they? Why do they buy from me? How often? How can I better support their needs?</li>\n<li>Once you’ve identified your current customers you need to think about how you can reach more people like them.</li>\n<li>Work with digital marketing experts to grow your customer base. Partner with someone that will teach you as much or as little as you’d like to learn.</li>\n<li>Avoid unscrupulous marketing and media companies rely on uneducated customers that don’t understand digital or what they are selling. Our team always recommends that you understand what you’re spending your budget on. You don’t need to be an expert but you should have a general understanding of digital tactics.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you’re a current yellow pages customer you’ve likely been pitched on their digital solutions. A word of caution here. Yellow Page companies are shifting to digital, while bundling their print products with cookie cutter digital campaigns. They bundle Google Ad Words, Display, reputation management and other “buzzword compliant” digital advertising methods with their ineffective print products in order to hit a quota. It hasn’t been working. In 2011 Dex and SuperMedia had to <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-03-18/dex-supermedia-file-for-bankruptcy-to-complete-merger\">file bankruptcy</a> in order to complete their merger. But the troubles don’t end there for yellow page companies. Just last month Hibu, a UK yellow page company that operates here in the U.S., <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIrYm9uu7OAhWJ2yYKHTuwA8AQFggmMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fyellow-pages-publisher-hibu-files-u-s-bankruptcy-case-1470422933&amp;usg=AFQjCNG7bb3dpyMiDq_9AzndOGsVuKDVwQ&amp;sig2=LgjaKxNJz4t9IEiRhVgTTQ&amp;bvm=bv.131286987,d.eWE\">filed for bankruptcy</a> protection for the second time in two years.</p>\n<p>We’ve worked directly with hundreds of customers and former customers of these massive legacy yellow page companies. Over that time we’ve learned that high pressure <a href=\"http://www.tbse.com/check-your-yellow-pages-listing-agreement-immediately/\">sales tactics</a> and subpar, intentionally confusing products are at alive and well. We’re here to help.</p>",

In a recent discussion I had with ADM’s lead designer, Vicki Holmes, she mentioned that there are three main things to consider when creating your logo:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1.<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>Style – The style of your logo should take into consideration what industry your business is in and who is the intended audience. For example, a hospital would have a much more sophisticated logo with a clean look, compared to a children’s daycare, which would be more colorful and fun.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2.<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>Color Scheme –What color or colors do you want associated with your business? The colors should not be too light or too close to the colors your competitors use. It should also be taken into consideration how the logo will be used – outdoor signage, embroidery, business cards, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3.<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>Tagline – Often we will find that a logo itself does not explain what a business actually does. A tagline can be important to explain to the consumer what your business has to offer them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once your logo has been created, you are ready to look at the overall branding of your business. Branding should always be cohesive regardless of the type of media you are advertising in. This ensures that the consumer will recognize your business wherever they see it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;ADM will often work with businesses on rebranding. Sometimes the business has changed owners or it just needs a new, refreshed look. ADM is here to help in that process. We can assist the business owner by collecting all different types of logos or non-cohesive ads that have been running and discuss which features are the strongest. Working with our team of designers, we create a variety of logos and once one is decided on, we will provide a style guide that can be used and sent out to anyone creating something for the company. A style guide provides the fonts, colors and any specific instructions regarding the logo and branding of the business. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

Airline Road in Victoria.&nbsp;Over 200 were in attendance to see the new space, network and meet members of the Advocate Digital Media team.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2430639/Advocate_Digital_Sep_2016/Images/cd45d426-8077-4445-8b69-87d6fae4f65d.jpg\" alt=\"Large Turnout at ADM’s Business After Hours\" title=\"Large Turnout at ADM’s Business After Hours\" width=\"1499\" caption=\"false\" data-constrained=\"true\" style=\"width: 1499px;\"><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>“This move is a continuation of our shift in the past two years to a full-service digital advertising agency, “ said Jason Holmes, general manager of ADM. “We were thrilled with the turnout and the opportunity to show the business community our new modern space.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2430639/Advocate_Digital_Sep_2016/Images/7fa8938b-0e28-41b8-b5fa-10539e7b7772.jpg\" alt=\"Large Turnout at ADM’s Business After Hours\" title=\"Large Turnout at ADM’s Business After Hours\" width=\"1499\" caption=\"false\" data-constrained=\"true\" style=\"width: 1499px;\"><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>Location was one of the key determining factors in selecting CivilCorp for ADM’s new headquarters. “We sought out a space in a developing area of Victoria.

One of the most notable highlights is the open workspace where the developers, fulfillment and creative teams will be housed. The space supports collaboration between our production team in new and exciting ways. With large windows overlooking the Colony Creek Country Club golf course, the copious amount of natural light pouring into the space are a welcomed change of scenery.&nbsp;If you didn't have a chance to attend the event, please stop by for a tour and met the ADM team.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><br></span><img src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2430639/Advocate_Digital_Sep_2016/Images/7d25a180-b7eb-4475-82be-06020e50eccd.jpg\" alt=\"Large Turnout at ADM’s Business After Hours\" title=\"Large Turnout at ADM’s Business After Hours\" width=\"618\" caption=\"false\" data-constrained=\"true\" style=\"width: 618px;\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2430639/Advocate_Digital_Sep_2016/Images/840fd341-1cf8-42ea-acb5-8b0cf9ad65d3.jpg\" alt=\"Large Turnout at ADM’s Business After Hours\" title=\"Large Turnout at ADM’s Business After Hours\" width=\"618\" caption=\"false\" data-constrained=\"true\" style=\"width: 618px;\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Ben Wilson St. There also will be a lunch panel discussion.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Advocate Digital Media is a full-service digital agency and Google Partner.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">“Now, more than ever, business owners have to learn how to engage with consumers on their terms and where the customers are spending their time, such as on their phones, tablets and computers,” ADM General Manager Jason Holmes said. “At our event, they will learn how to plan and budget to reach this shifting audience.”&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Many of the panels and discussions will focus on different aspects of digital marketing from the role it plays in everyday life to tools that evaluate the effectiveness of digital marketing strategies. One presentation that will be of interest to many small business owners is Budgeting for Digital and 2016 Digital Projections, which will be presented by Holmes.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">“This is a question we often are asked by business owners who have not budgeted for digital in the past,” Holmes said. “They are not sure how much to allocate to it and where exactly to spend it since there are many ways to market a business online.”&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The lunch panel discussion, sponsored by The UPS Store, will focus on content marketing. Content marketing is the key to reaching consumers in a world where they are used to blocking, fast forwarding and tuning out the traditional advertising around them. Panelists include Holmes; Jennifer Love, ADM digital sales director; Rebekah Steen, ADM’s lead fulfillment specialist; and Jun Yang, a UHV associate professor of marketing. Humphreys will be the panel moderator.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">“In today’s fast-paced, information-rich society, businesses need to constantly work to keep up with relevant marketing strategies,” said Farhang Niroomand, dean of the UHV School of Business Administration. “This expo will help equip area business owners for success. The UHV SBDC is proud to partner with Advocate Digital Media to offer this event to the community.”&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>Other topics covered include mobile strategy, marketing plan creation, engaging social media and using Google Analytics. <span style=\"color: #000000;\">Tickets for DMX are $45 in advance or $60 at the door and can be purchased at <a href=\"http://dmxexpo2016.eventzilla.net/\" target=\"_blank\">dmxexpo2016.eventzilla.net</a>.</span></p>",

You probably remember or can guess the outcome. Our hero chooses the Red Pill, and it’s a painful choice.</p>\n<p>So how can this movie scene possibly relate to marketing? If you think of our digital culture as the way the world really is and the traditional media landscape as the “Blue Pill” world you thought you knew, then this analogy fits well. Just imagine how painful it can be for a business owner with a limited marketing budget to “wake up” and realize their expensive, traditional advertising spend isn’t as effective as it used to be while further learning they aren’t reaching anyone in the digital culture. Not as bad as waking to the post apocalyptic existence faced by Neo, but an expensive dream nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Now I can hear some of you saying “well that might be true for ‘Techies’ that watch The Matrix but…” To which I say, the lowly banner ad is 21 years old.

Today, consumers can choose to ignore brands and advertising messages like never before.</p>\n<p>Until they need you, they don’t want to hear from you as a brand and really don’t care about your products or services. But when they need you, they expect you to be accessible and ubiquitous. You have to own your business category where consumers live and they increasingly live a digital lifestyle.</p>\n<p>This is why national brands are spending so much money on digital marketing, or marketing that “just happens to be digital.”</p>\n<p>The digital culture that has taken over our society since the proliferation of smart phones and tablets. Since the 2009 release of the iPhone 3GS – the first iPhone that supported an acceptable Internet experience – the world has changed and advertising budgets have shifted in response.</p>\n<p>In 2009, digital advertising spend accounted for just 18.4% of all local advertising dollars in the Victoria market and 16.2% in the Longview market. According to Borrell Associates, our best source for local advertising forecasts, digital advertising will make up about 47% of all advertising spending in Victoria Texas and 42.9% in Longview in 2016!</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, more than half of that spend is coming from big brands reaching into the market and building their customer base, many times at the expense of local businesses.</p>\n<p>So if you’re a business owner or in charge of marketing a local business have you allowed this disruption to just “happen around you”? Or have you drastically changed your approach in meaningful ways?</p>",

Their comedic pause immediately after surprises the viewer enough to see the GEICO logo pop up and hear to the sales pitch, including GEICO’s famous “15 minutes/15 percent” slogan.</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">Within five seconds, GEICO has established the perfect pre-roll, something with humor, effective reach and a strong brand message - exactly what a consumer will allow without feeling frustrated before watching their favorite music video or streaming their favorite TV show.</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">When done well, such as the videos in this GEICO campaign, pre-roll ads are an effective way to reach new clients and customers.</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">According to Reel SEO and the Online Publishers Association, 80% of internet users recall watching a video ad in the past thirty days and 46% of users took action on the video advertisement.</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">Additionally, 26% looked for more information about the subject of the ad, 22% visited the website named in the ad and 12% actually purchased the product featured in the ad!</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">That’s a lot of business for a campaign that’s getting tons of viral digital video looks.</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">Let us help you craft your next digital video campaign, and give you innovative creative services that will bring more business to your company.</span>&nbsp;</p>",

While this data isn’t perfect it’s getting more accurate all of the time and Google is getting better at tracking users across multiple devices.</span></span></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span color=\"#636363\" style=\"color: #636363;\"><strong><span>Sessions:</span></strong><span> In another change, “visits” became “sessions.” Each time a user visits a website Google records that visit as a session. Regardless of the device, Google records each and every session, the platform and the behavior of the user while on the site (and sometimes after they leave the site, but that’s for another column!)</span></span></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span color=\"#636363\" style=\"color: #636363;\"><strong><span>Session Duration:</span></strong><span> This is the amount of time a user spends during a visit. Google tracks individual sessions, their durations and then reports an average.</span></span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Now, about bounce rate. Bounce rate is the percentage of sessions that a user visits a single page. For instance, if 10 users visit a website and half of those visitors only visit one page then the bounce rate for that segment of users would be 50%. The question we get asked fairly often is “is this bounce rate good?” Generally, the answer is “it depends.” The fact of the matter is that there is no bounce rate percentage that is “good” or even average. Here’s why:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">News websites with engaging yet ever changing content can experience radically fluctuating bounce rates. Some days they may be at 70% while other times they may be at 30%. This is true for your site as well. If a retailer publishes a blog or other unique content to their site then users may visit that page and then leave. In fact, if a particular product, offer or other page on your site is very popular and gets shared on social media you’re likely to experience a higher bounce rate site wide. This is because users coming to your site through Facebook or Twitter are more likely to be interested in a single piece of content and then they move on. About 70% of social media sessions are mobile which also adds to the likelihood of a higher bounce rate. Users on mobile devices just tend to visit fewer pages per session overall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Several other factors can increase or reduce bounce rate as well.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span color=\"#636363\" style=\"color: #636363;\"><strong><span>Advertising Campaigns:</span></strong><span> Advertising campaigns, even when executed by a professional team and through high quality media can actually increase your sites bounce rate. This is because users that click on a particular offer or ad unit aren’t interested in navigating your entire website. They are clicking on your offer to get more information, get your phone number or get the address of your store. In this instance the more efficient your site the higher your bounce rate.</span></span></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span color=\"#636363\" style=\"color: #636363;\"><strong><span>Poorly Designed Sites:</span></strong><span> Site that are poorly designed are difficult to navigate can actually have lower bounce rates than much better, well designed sites. This is a conundrum, as users aren’t getting a quality user experience yet a low bounce rate can be seen as a good thing even though your users are frustrated because they can’t find what they need and are fumbling through your site.</span></span></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span color=\"#636363\" style=\"color: #636363;\"><strong><span>Efficiently Designed Sites:</span></strong><span> You can probably guess that a very well designed site that gets useful information in front of consumers quickly can have a high bounce rate. Combine this type of site with a targeted, efficient advertising campaign and you will likely see an increase in bounce rate.</span></span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">So how do you, as the marketer interpret your bounce rate? First, it’s important to get a baseline for your site and understand what metrics are “normal” for you. What are users looking at? Where are they coming from and why are leaving?

Bounce rate is the percentage of sessions that a user visits a single page. For instance, if 10 users visit a website and half of those visitors only visit one page then the bounce rate for that segment of users would be 50%.

Here’s why:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">News websites with engaging yet ever changing content can experience radically fluctuating bounce rates. Some days they may be at 70% while other times they may be at 30%. This is true for your site as well. If a retailer publishes a blog or other unique content to their site then users may visit that page and then leave. In fact, if a particular product, offer or other page on your site is very popular and gets shared on social media you’re likely to experience a higher bounce rate site wide. This is because users coming to your site through Facebook or Twitter are more likely to be interested in a single piece of content and then they move on. About 70% of social media sessions are mobile which also adds to the likelihood of a higher bounce rate. Users on mobile devices just tend to visit fewer pages per session overall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Several other factors can increase or reduce bounce rate as well.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span color=\"#636363\" style=\"color: #636363;\"><strong><span>Advertising Campaigns:</span></strong><span> Advertising campaigns, even when executed by a professional team and through high quality media can actually increase your sites bounce rate. This is because users that click on a particular offer or ad unit aren’t interested in navigating your entire website. They are clicking on your offer to get more information, get your phone number or get the address of your store. In this instance the more efficient your site the higher your bounce rate.</span></span></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span color=\"#636363\" style=\"color: #636363;\"><strong><span>Poorly Designed Sites:</span></strong><span> Site that are poorly designed are difficult to navigate can actually have lower bounce rates than much better, well designed sites.

PPC (Pay per click) advertising, invented by Overture and perfected by Google, changed the world of marketing forever.

Much like print, radio or local TV news and entertainment websites, particularly those with in-depth local content, can reach consumers before they are ready to buy a given product. This is important for marketers because every consumer starts their shopping journey before they even realize they’re in the market. The “top of the funnel” is just as important as the bottom.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">So, what are your best options for reaching consumers at the beginning and using the Internet to brand your business?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong><span>Native Advertising:</span></strong><span> native advertising has been on a rampage over the past two years. According to a <a href=\"http://marketingland.com/native-advertising-budgets-will-rise-2015-say-marketers-116355\" target=\"_blank\">survey conducted</a> by the Association Of National Advertisers in the fourth quarter of 2014, native advertising grew 58% last year. Business Insider is projecting the segment <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/spending-on-native-ads-will-soar-as-publishers-and-advertisers-take-notice-2014-11\" target=\"_blank\">will grow to nearly $8 billion this</a> year, up from $4.7 billion in 2013. The projection over the next three years has native advertising reaching $21 billion. But, why all of the enthusiasm over native? Simply put: native works! Neuroscience <a href=\"http://www.ad-tech.com/ny/page.cfm/action=Press/libID=1/libEntryID=19/listID=2\" target=\"_blank\">has recently shown</a> that native ad units are more than twice as effective in grabbing attention versus the traditional banner. The beauty of native for the advertiser lies in its flexibility. When executed properly, the marketer can frame themselves as the “mindshare” leader in their product space. Consumers at the top of the funnel are more likely to trust the marketer that has presented or sponsored authoritative content. Native advertising content must be of high quality and not a sales pitch. As is always true, high quality advertising performs best when surrounded by high quality, relevant content. <span>&nbsp;</span>When this is the case, a native advertising piece can perform as well as some of the editorial content that it’s surrounded by.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong><span>Digital Display:</span></strong><span> Digital Display is commonly used by marketers to efficiently increase reach. For the local advertiser, news and information sites that are relevant to your customer base and provide deep, quality content are an excellent choice for positioning your brand. We routinely see that campaigns executed on local, relevant sites perform better than other types of display campaigns. Despite all of the behavioral and social targeting technologies we incorporate into many of our campaigns nothing beats a well-done display ad on a quality local site. Generally, the click-through rates we see are two to three times higher on quality local sites.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong><span>Social Media:</span></strong><span> Social Media is truly the new word of mouth. An effective social media strategy is necessary in today’s competitive local marketing environment. Like native advertising, social can help brand the advertiser and position themselves as the expert in their industry. Promoting the right content is key to the branding strategy and is easily integrated into a native advertising plan. Good native content is inherently social and engaging.</span></span></p>",

The old way of advertising only included estimated reach and frequency statistics but it was impossible to prove whether consumers were engaged. Now with advanced analytics, you can see who is watching your message and if they were engaged with your video. You can also run A/B testing to see if one video does better and gets more engagement.

A ReelSEO study showed that 71% of the respondents confirmed that video converts better than other content.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #636363;\">We can all agree that video sets your company apart and is an effective tool for reaching your consumers. But how do you make it work for your company? Here are seven tips to get you started!&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica; color: #636363;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\">1.&nbsp;</span><span>Distribute and promote your video through every channel available. These include email marketing, social media channels, online ad campaigns, YouTube and your own website.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica; color: #636363;\">2. Make sure you are including information in your video on how your customer can find you. If you have a brick and mortar location, you might even want to include a map.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica; color: #636363;\"><span>3. Don’t forget to give your video a call to action. Tell them what to do next. Do you want them to call you? Or maybe click through to your website? Or just to stop by? Make sure you give clear instructions on what the consumer should do after watching your video.</span><span><span style=\"line-height: normal;\">&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica; color: #636363;\">4. Make the message personal. Add a testimonial or recommendation from a customer or have the message come from yourself of an actual employee.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica; color: #636363;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\">5.&nbsp;</span><span>Combine video and still images of your company location, employees, products or anything you believe will add interest and add variety to generate more engaged consumers.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-indent: -0.5in; font-family: Helvetica; color: #636363;\">6. Make your video short! It shouldn’t be longer than 30 seconds. Studies have proven that we have an attention span of about 30 seconds so keep you video to this time frame. To help with this you can do a series of videos that continues a thought or idea.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-indent: -0.5in; font-family: Helvetica; color: #636363;\">7. Remember that everybody likes to laugh so a little humor never hurts! Humor makes your company more approachable and builds a relationship with your consumer.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #636363;\">Your business needs video -- it sets you apart from your competition and makes you stand out online. Video allows you to tell your consumer what makes you different from your competitor.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #636363;\">Video helps you start a conversation and also keeps you as part of the conversation.

The increase of mobile use &nbsp;means an increase in the types of devices available. &nbsp;The differences between phone, tablet, and desktop are beginning to blur. Tablets are becoming more like laptops. &nbsp;In the same vein, </span><a href=\"http://www.androidpolice.com/2014/05/29/an-exhaustive-statistical-analysis-of-smartphone-screen-size-over-time-yup-theyre-getting-bigger/\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; text-decoration: underline;\">the average screen size of phones keeps increasing</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 15px;\">. The industry refers to this as convergence. It’s not just the device either. You can run Android on a phone, tablet and laptop if you choose. Apple built iOS from the same foundation that they built their desktop releases of OS X. Users are adapting to all these changes and new options. How is your business adapting?</span></span></span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin: 0;\"><span><span style=\"font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: #636363;\">&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span style=\"font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.38;\"><span style=\"color: #636363;\">These developments affect you and your business in many ways. When users come to your site on a mobile device, they want it to work like it would on their desktop. If your mobile site is missing major features available on desktop, you’re at a disadvantage. The web design industry’s response to this is responsive web design. &nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin: 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><span style=\"color: #636363;\">Responsive web design &nbsp;can make your site function the same whether you are on your phone, tablet or laptop. It does this by taking the size of the screen into account and resizing the content accordingly. This way, when I go to the Victoria Advocate’s website to read the news on my mobile phone, instead of trying &nbsp;to squeeze a wide page into a narrow screen making it unreadable, the content merely reorganizes itself to fit my screen size. If I switch my phone from portrait mode to landscape, the content will again detect this change and respond accordingly. This results in a consistent experience across all devices. &nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span style=\"color: #636363;\"><br><span style=\"font-size: 15px;\">Your site’s visitors will thank you for using responsive web design. Advocate Digital Media only builds responsive websites for our clients. As technologists, we see this as the natural next step in web design. As a business owner, you will want your business and brand to be associated with a flexible modern design. It’s easy to get started. Simply reach out to your Advocate Digital Media account executive to learn about our reasonably priced WebPro packages so we can start working on your responsive site today. </span></span></span></p>",

If that wasn’t sophisticated enough, you can blend all of these targeting strategies. That’s the beauty. Every business’s target customer is going to be different.

Advertising can often be an overwhelming task for a business owner to tackle, with many different media options and uncertainties of the most effective outlet to reach their target audience. Working with an advertising agency can provide guidance when it comes to budgeting and media buying, it also will ensure a consistent and professional branding across all medias.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Advocate Digital Media is a full-service advertising agency with a digital focus. As the media landscape continues to see a shift from traditional advertising to digital, it is important that the advertising agency that a business is working with is familiar with the vast array of digital advertising services available. While ADM can serve as your local go-to for logo design, websites, advanced targeting, Google AdWords, YouTube Truview, Pandora, Hulu and other digital avenues, we also have the ability to assist with other media buys. An advertising agency can serve as a “gatekeeper” between you and the other media companies; negotiating rates, ad placement and often having the inside scoop when it comes to specials or sponsorship opportunities.

If you missed the commercial, it was unusually sad for a Super Bowl spot. It featured a young boy around seven years old recounting all of the things he’ll never do like “get cooties” or “learn to fly.” The spot has a happy feeling and utilizes fantasy related imagery throughout. It isn’t until the end that we learn the boy couldn’t do any of these things because he died from an accident. The call to action was to #makesafehappen. It’s a powerful spot seen by the largest television audience in history but it was the wrong place for a depressing ad.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">The Internet took offense to the spot with 64% of tweets being negative. Tweets like:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">“Thanks Nationwide. We were all in danger of having a fun Sunday.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">“Nationwide: Think of us as the Dead Kid Company”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">\"Hope you guys are having a great day. Did you know your kid is probably gonna die soon? Enjoy your nachos &amp; funeral planning!\" - Nationwide</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">The spot didn’t “start a conversation” as Nationwide claimed was the intent in its apology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">Of course, the Internet has a sense of humor and within minutes Internet memes were using the kid from the commercial to say things like “I would have run it with Lynch but I died.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">The point is that as a brand owner, large or small, you need to be certain your creative matches the audience and is memorable for the right reasons. Nationwide’s spot will be remembered but for all the wrong reasons. Millions wasted and incalculable damage to the brand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">The mistake is compounded by the fact that this is one of the few remaining opportunities to reach a live audience on traditional television. A new study out just this month by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/04/netflix-streaming-video-record-drops-in-us-tv-viewing\" target=\"_blank\">Nomura</a> shows a one-year decline in traditional television viewing of 12% while digital competitors like Hulu, Amazon and other streaming services showed double digital growth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">National advertisers are generally the ones that push it too far and miss the mark like this example because of their willingness to roll the dice. Local businesses generally employ easily forgettable creative that is “brand safe” yet still a waste. The key is creating something memorable that connects with your local audience and reaches them where and when they are receptive to your message.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">If your marketing efforts haven’t really changed in decades or you’re not sure how to reach today’s mobile and social consumer then make sure you work with someone that can help you update your approach while protecting your brand.</span></span></p>",

It isn’t until the end that we learn the boy couldn’t do any of these things because he died from an accident. The call to action was to #makesafehappen. It’s a powerful spot seen by the largest television audience in history but it was the wrong place for a depressing ad.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">The Internet took offense to the spot with 64% of tweets being negative. Tweets like:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">“Thanks Nationwide. We were all in danger of having a fun Sunday.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">“Nationwide: Think of us as the Dead Kid Company”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">\"Hope you guys are having a great day. Did you know your kid is probably gonna die soon? Enjoy your nachos &amp; funeral planning!\" - Nationwide</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">The spot didn’t “start a conversation” as Nationwide claimed was the intent in its apology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">Of course, the Internet has a sense of humor and within minutes Internet memes were using the kid from the commercial to say things like “I would have run it with Lynch but I died.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">The point is that as a brand owner, large or small, you need to be certain your creative matches the audience and is memorable for the right reasons. Nationwide’s spot will be remembered but for all the wrong reasons. Millions wasted and incalculable damage to the brand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">The mistake is compounded by the fact that this is one of the few remaining opportunities to reach a live audience on traditional television. A new study out just this month by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/04/netflix-streaming-video-record-drops-in-us-tv-viewing\" target=\"_blank\">Nomura</a> shows a one-year decline in traditional television viewing of 12% while digital competitors like Hulu, Amazon and other streaming services showed double digital growth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">National advertisers are generally the ones that push it too far and miss the mark like this example because of their willingness to roll the dice. Local businesses generally employ easily forgettable creative that is “brand safe” yet still a waste. The key is creating something memorable that connects with your local audience and reaches them where and when they are receptive to your message.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">If your marketing efforts haven’t really changed in decades or you’re not sure how to reach today’s mobile and social consumer then make sure you work with someone that can help you update your approach while protecting your brand.</span></span></p>",

Tweets like:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">“Thanks Nationwide. We were all in danger of having a fun Sunday.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">“Nationwide: Think of us as the Dead Kid Company”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">\"Hope you guys are having a great day. Did you know your kid is probably gonna die soon? Enjoy your nachos &amp; funeral planning!\" - Nationwide</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">The spot didn’t “start a conversation” as Nationwide claimed was the intent in its apology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">Of course, the Internet has a sense of humor and within minutes Internet memes were using the kid from the commercial to say things like “I would have run it with Lynch but I died.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">The point is that as a brand owner, large or small, you need to be certain your creative matches the audience and is memorable for the right reasons. Nationwide’s spot will be remembered but for all the wrong reasons. Millions wasted and incalculable damage to the brand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">The mistake is compounded by the fact that this is one of the few remaining opportunities to reach a live audience on traditional television. A new study out just this month by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/04/netflix-streaming-video-record-drops-in-us-tv-viewing\" target=\"_blank\">Nomura</a> shows a one-year decline in traditional television viewing of 12% while digital competitors like Hulu, Amazon and other streaming services showed double digital growth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">National advertisers are generally the ones that push it too far and miss the mark like this example because of their willingness to roll the dice. Local businesses generally employ easily forgettable creative that is “brand safe” yet still a waste. The key is creating something memorable that connects with your local audience and reaches them where and when they are receptive to your message.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">If your marketing efforts haven’t really changed in decades or you’re not sure how to reach today’s mobile and social consumer then make sure you work with someone that can help you update your approach while protecting your brand.</span></span></p>",
            "rss_summary": "<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">This column generally includes a lot of mind-numbing stats that tell a story. However, the Internet is human and humans are social. This was evident during the Super Bowl; the reactions on Twitter and Facebook to plays on the field were swift and ubiquitous. Likewise, the reactions to the season’s most anticipated commercials were also immediate and judgmental.</span></p>\n",

Sadly, many local merchants just aren’t ready to compete with big box stores and online retailers like Amazon and Wal-Mart.</span></p>\n<!--more--><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\">Many local consumer--facing businesses are under the impression that they’re stuck in a disadvantaged position when trying to appeal to the same customers as their online counterparts. This line of thinking is dangerous for local businesses. Locally owned stores have many advantages that they need to capitalize on if they plan to compete. However, they have to think about where the people they’re trying to reach are spending most of their time. The answer these days is online and in particularly on their mobile devices.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\">Consider this: 64% of Black Friday shoppers researched in-store Black Friday deals online before going shopping. This is more than 10 times the number of people that tuned in to the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade and NFL football on Thanksgiving Day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\">How did your store compete? Did they find your products and services or your competitors? These are shoppers ready to buy in the physical world. They want to view and touch the merchandise before taking it home. They want to feel like they’re getting a good deal and enjoy the experience. But they want a preview online before they commit and drive to your store.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\">In the weeks leading up to Black Friday, a few local merchants targeted me (and probably you) online. These local advertising messages always stand out to me when they’re well targeted and relevant. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\">If you’ve missed out so far, where do you start? Over the past year this space has been used to help you improve your digital presence and build awareness for your brand, products and services utilizing tactics that touch on social media, search, targeted display, mobile and the red hot category of digital video. Obviously, if you haven’t taken action up to this point then it hasn’t been a priority. I’d encourage you not to make the same mistake in 2015.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">As a recap, here are my recommended steps to get started:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;\">&nbsp;Evaluate your web presence.

Digital advertising is projected to comprise more than 35% of all advertising spend within our market this year – ballooning to nearly 55% in five years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\">As a business owner that’s responsible for marketing, you owe it to yourself, your employees and even your customers to align your business’ marketing strategy with this digital reality. This is especially true when entrusting a partner like an advertising agency to execute your advertising and marketing strategy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\">As we prepare for the fourth quarter, I’d encourage you to evaluate and reevaluate your advertising agency relationship. Digital marketing isn’t a fad or something that should be an afterthought in your overall marketing strategy. How do you verify a contender’s credentials?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\"><strong>Social Media:</strong>&nbsp;I’ll start with social, not because it’s the most effective marketing tool but because it’s probably the channel that we get the most questions about. Does your agency candidate “get” social media? Can they demonstrate and explain effective strategies that build audience but also ensure wide distribution of your marketing message and convert likes and followers into customers? At the very least, make sure that the agency you are entrusting with your social media strategy is active on social and growing their own social footprint. See how one business made signifcant strides in growing their footprint and developed an active social platform by clicking the link below to review our Booming Port Lavaca Social Media Case Study.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\">{{cta('1a0c8da0-0405-4e0b-bb96-6e187f8b0221')}}</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\"><strong>Search:</strong>&nbsp;For the most part, the Internet is still all about search. With an incredible 68% in search engine market share, Google by far should be your primary concern in this space. Any agency worth your time to needs to understand Search Engine Marketing (SEM) and Search Engine Optimization (SEO). You shouldn’t have to be an expert as a customer but your agency needs to be able to execute on-page and off-page SEO strategies while complimenting organic search optimization with SEM campaigns that make sense and maximize your established budget. Poorly managed campaigns can quickly waste your budget and shouldn’t be handled by noncertified personnel.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\"><strong>Mobile:</strong>&nbsp;I’ve used this column to address mobile more than any other subject. The Internet is mobile. Social is mobile. Consumers expect your business to be accessible on their device. As a marketer, you get no better opportunity to reach consumers where they live on a platform that is closer to them than anything we’ve ever seen. Without a responsive design website and a mobile strategy, you’re missing a once in a generation opportunity. Questions to your agency on this subject should include case studies and references from customers that are reaching mobile consumers and have a completely mobile digital strategy. Another quick way to rule out an agency contender is to view their site on your smartphone. Is it completely unstable? Is it responsive? If the answer to either of these questions is no then I’d advise you to move on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\"><strong>Digital Display:</strong>&nbsp;Your agency needs to be able to execute a targeted digital display campaign that extends your brand and message on national and niche sites all over the Internet. This type of campaign used to be a novelty but now it’s one of the fastest growing and most effective methods of reaching consumers when they’re ready to buy. If your agency isn't prepared to effectively explain, design and implement this type of campaign then you need to reevaluate your agency relationship.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\">Video:&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\">Digital video has come of age over the past few years. Services like Netflix and Hulu have changed the way consumers watch video and think about TV in general. Time shifting via DVRs was the first step in this disruption. Internet distribution on these platforms is speeding up. Be certain your agency can craft a plan to reach consumers across the most popular video channels.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\"><span>This list isn’t entirely complete. Hopefully, this gives you a few talking points to address with your agency candidates.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\">About: Jason Holmes is the General Manager of Advocate Digital Media, a sister company to The Victoria Advocate that focuses on digital marketing.

In the future, it appears all media will eventually be digital. The trend doesn’t lie.</span></p>\n<!--more-->\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\">We know from our interaction with local businesses and data sources like Borrell Associates that national and local businesses have made digital media the biggest chunk of their marketing and promotions budgets. Digital advertising is projected to comprise more than 35% of all advertising spend within our market this year – ballooning to nearly 55% in five years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\">As a business owner that’s responsible for marketing, you owe it to yourself, your employees and even your customers to align your business’ marketing strategy with this digital reality. This is especially true when entrusting a partner like an advertising agency to execute your advertising and marketing strategy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\">As we prepare for the fourth quarter, I’d encourage you to evaluate and reevaluate your advertising agency relationship. Digital marketing isn’t a fad or something that should be an afterthought in your overall marketing strategy. How do you verify a contender’s credentials?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\"><strong>Social Media:</strong>&nbsp;I’ll start with social, not because it’s the most effective marketing tool but because it’s probably the channel that we get the most questions about. Does your agency candidate “get” social media? Can they demonstrate and explain effective strategies that build audience but also ensure wide distribution of your marketing message and convert likes and followers into customers? At the very least, make sure that the agency you are entrusting with your social media strategy is active on social and growing their own social footprint.

With an incredible 68% in search engine market share, Google by far should be your primary concern in this space. Any agency worth your time to needs to understand Search Engine Marketing (SEM) and Search Engine Optimization (SEO). You shouldn’t have to be an expert as a customer but your agency needs to be able to execute on-page and off-page SEO strategies while complimenting organic search optimization with SEM campaigns that make sense and maximize your established budget. Poorly managed campaigns can quickly waste your budget and shouldn’t be handled by noncertified personnel.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\"><strong>Mobile:</strong>&nbsp;I’ve used this column to address mobile more than any other subject. The Internet is mobile. Social is mobile. Consumers expect your business to be accessible on their device. As a marketer, you get no better opportunity to reach consumers where they live on a platform that is closer to them than anything we’ve ever seen. Without a responsive design website and a mobile strategy, you’re missing a once in a generation opportunity. Questions to your agency on this subject should include case studies and references from customers that are reaching mobile consumers and have a completely mobile digital strategy. Another quick way to rule out an agency contender is to view their site on your smartphone. Is it completely unstable? Is it responsive? If the answer to either of these questions is no then I’d advise you to move on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\"><strong>Digital Display:</strong>&nbsp;Your agency needs to be able to execute a targeted digital display campaign that extends your brand and message on national and niche sites all over the Internet. This type of campaign used to be a novelty but now it’s one of the fastest growing and most effective methods of reaching consumers when they’re ready to buy. If your agency isn't prepared to effectively explain, design and implement this type of campaign then you need to reevaluate your agency relationship.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\">Video:&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\">Digital video has come of age over the past few years. Services like Netflix and Hulu have changed the way consumers watch video and think about TV in general. Time shifting via DVRs was the first step in this disruption. Internet distribution on these platforms is speeding up. Be certain your agency can craft a plan to reach consumers across the most popular video channels.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\"><span>This list isn’t entirely complete.

Digital advertising is projected to comprise more than 35% of all advertising spend within our market this year – ballooning to nearly 55% in five years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\">As a business owner that’s responsible for marketing, you owe it to yourself, your employees and even your customers to align your business’ marketing strategy with this digital reality. This is especially true when entrusting a partner like an advertising agency to execute your advertising and marketing strategy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\">As we prepare for the fourth quarter, I’d encourage you to evaluate and reevaluate your advertising agency relationship. Digital marketing isn’t a fad or something that should be an afterthought in your overall marketing strategy. How do you verify a contender’s credentials?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\"><strong>Social Media:</strong>&nbsp;I’ll start with social, not because it’s the most effective marketing tool but because it’s probably the channel that we get the most questions about. Does your agency candidate “get” social media? Can they demonstrate and explain effective strategies that build audience but also ensure wide distribution of your marketing message and convert likes and followers into customers? At the very least, make sure that the agency you are entrusting with your social media strategy is active on social and growing their own social footprint. See how one business made signifcant strides in growing their footprint and developed an active social platform by clicking the link below to review our Booming Port Lavaca Social Media Case Study.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\">{{cta('1a0c8da0-0405-4e0b-bb96-6e187f8b0221')}}</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\"><strong>Search:</strong>&nbsp;For the most part, the Internet is still all about search. With an incredible 68% in search engine market share, Google by far should be your primary concern in this space. Any agency worth your time to needs to understand Search Engine Marketing (SEM) and Search Engine Optimization (SEO). You shouldn’t have to be an expert as a customer but your agency needs to be able to execute on-page and off-page SEO strategies while complimenting organic search optimization with SEM campaigns that make sense and maximize your established budget. Poorly managed campaigns can quickly waste your budget and shouldn’t be handled by noncertified personnel.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\"><strong>Mobile:</strong>&nbsp;I’ve used this column to address mobile more than any other subject. The Internet is mobile. Social is mobile. Consumers expect your business to be accessible on their device. As a marketer, you get no better opportunity to reach consumers where they live on a platform that is closer to them than anything we’ve ever seen. Without a responsive design website and a mobile strategy, you’re missing a once in a generation opportunity. Questions to your agency on this subject should include case studies and references from customers that are reaching mobile consumers and have a completely mobile digital strategy. Another quick way to rule out an agency contender is to view their site on your smartphone. Is it completely unstable? Is it responsive? If the answer to either of these questions is no then I’d advise you to move on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\"><strong>Digital Display:</strong>&nbsp;Your agency needs to be able to execute a targeted digital display campaign that extends your brand and message on national and niche sites all over the Internet. This type of campaign used to be a novelty but now it’s one of the fastest growing and most effective methods of reaching consumers when they’re ready to buy. If your agency isn't prepared to effectively explain, design and implement this type of campaign then you need to reevaluate your agency relationship.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\">Video:&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\">Digital video has come of age over the past few years. Services like Netflix and Hulu have changed the way consumers watch video and think about TV in general. Time shifting via DVRs was the first step in this disruption. Internet distribution on these platforms is speeding up. Be certain your agency can craft a plan to reach consumers across the most popular video channels.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;\"><span>This list isn’t entirely complete.

What's the real value of a like?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">As with all things marketing, the answer is \"it depends.\" A targeted like, one from a user that is local, can afford your product and is in the demographic that you're trying to reach, can be extremely valuable.

However, how many of those people are actually looking to buy a vehicle at any one time? The truth is about 1 percent of the population is in the market for a new or used vehicle at any given time. This means that in this example, our auto dealer is reaching about 10 potential customers with every Facebook post, which is not bad, because the 1 percent rule for auto dealers is true regardless of the marketing vehicle chosen. It doesn't matter if it's digital advertising, print, TV or direct mail - 99 percent of the population isn't in the market for a vehicle. The 1 percent that is in the market can be extremely valuable, and some of them will be reached and converted into customers through social media.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">{{cta('1a0c8da0-0405-4e0b-bb96-6e187f8b0221')}}</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">What about small, local businesses? Do likes have value for them? I would argue yes. They are even more valuable than for businesses that sell high-ticket items. Why? It's simple: frequency of purchase. Most consumers purchase a vehicle or a room full of furniture every few years. These types of retailers have to be relevant when the consumer is ready to buy. No way around it.

Meanwhile, tablet and smartphone sales have continued to grow, outpacing all PC sales, including laptops.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">However, for you as a marketer, usage is a more important trend. Are consumers using their smartphones and tablets to shop? According to ComScore, they are. Eighty percent of smartphone owners use their device for shopping, and mobile adoption rates are eight times faster than web adoption rates in the 1990s and early 2000s. Smartphone and tablet usage will overtake desktop and laptop usage this year.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">This migration to mobile is a huge cultural shift, and it's only speeding up. The local business owners I speak with are usually of one of two minds:</p>\n<ol style=\"margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; list-style-position: inside; list-style-image: initial; color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">\n<li>This is a huge opportunity. I want to be where my customers and the next generation of customers are.</li>\n<li>I hate computers and the Internet. I can't compete with \"the Internet,\" so I'm not going to try.</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Business owners in the first group certainly hope that their local competitors think like group No. 2. When you see market trends as opportunities rather than just as threats, you can generally capitalize on expected changes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">One interesting way the local retailer fights back and actually capitalizes on mobile and the Internet as a whole is by having a professional Web presence that ranks well for terms, products and services that consumers are shopping for. This can lead to what's called \"reverse showrooming.\"</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Many of you are familiar with \"showrooming\" even if you aren't aware of the term. If you own or manage a brick-and-mortar store, you've seen consumers look over your products while comparing price and availability with online retailers on their phones. A staggering 46 percent of consumers are \"showroomers.\" Sometimes, the consumer buys the product or services from you, and sometimes, they go elsewhere.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">What you don't see are the consumers that \"reverse showroom.\" That is, use their mobile device to shop for a product or service online and then purchase offline. It may surprise you, but 69 percent of American consumers are \"reverse showroomers.\"</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">However, without a website that is responsive and works properly on all mobile devices, a social media plan and a digital marketing presence that reaches consumers where they live and shop, you're guaranteed not to participate in the \"reverse showrooming\" phenomena. Businesses in group one are already there.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">The Internet has been a disruptive force over the past two decades. New business models like search engines and social networks have emerged while other business models like traditional media and home telephone service have been challenged. Mobile devices are simply the next evolution in the cultural shift away from being tethered.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Jason Holmes is the general manager of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.advocatedigitalmedia.com/\" style=\"color: #0000ee;\" target=\"_blank\">Advocate Digital Media</a>, a sister company to The Victoria Advocate that focuses on digital marketing.

Sometime in the next three years - that's my prediction anyway.</p>\n<!--more--><p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Now don't misinterpret, desktops will still be available for special order, primarily used for offices and store point-of-sale systems, but consumers are all but done with them already.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">According to Gartner, global PC shipments fell 10 percent in 2013 with the trend speeding up in 2014. Meanwhile, tablet and smartphone sales have continued to grow, outpacing all PC sales, including laptops.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">However, for you as a marketer, usage is a more important trend. Are consumers using their smartphones and tablets to shop? According to ComScore, they are. Eighty percent of smartphone owners use their device for shopping, and mobile adoption rates are eight times faster than web adoption rates in the 1990s and early 2000s. Smartphone and tablet usage will overtake desktop and laptop usage this year.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">This migration to mobile is a huge cultural shift, and it's only speeding up. The local business owners I speak with are usually of one of two minds:</p>\n<ol style=\"margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; list-style-position: inside; list-style-image: initial; color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">\n<li>This is a huge opportunity. I want to be where my customers and the next generation of customers are.</li>\n<li>I hate computers and the Internet. I can't compete with \"the Internet,\" so I'm not going to try.</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Business owners in the first group certainly hope that their local competitors think like group No. 2. When you see market trends as opportunities rather than just as threats, you can generally capitalize on expected changes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">One interesting way the local retailer fights back and actually capitalizes on mobile and the Internet as a whole is by having a professional Web presence that ranks well for terms, products and services that consumers are shopping for. This can lead to what's called \"reverse showrooming.\"</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Many of you are familiar with \"showrooming\" even if you aren't aware of the term. If you own or manage a brick-and-mortar store, you've seen consumers look over your products while comparing price and availability with online retailers on their phones. A staggering 46 percent of consumers are \"showroomers.\" Sometimes, the consumer buys the product or services from you, and sometimes, they go elsewhere.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">What you don't see are the consumers that \"reverse showroom.\" That is, use their mobile device to shop for a product or service online and then purchase offline. It may surprise you, but 69 percent of American consumers are \"reverse showroomers.\"</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">However, without a website that is responsive and works properly on all mobile devices, a social media plan and a digital marketing presence that reaches consumers where they live and shop, you're guaranteed not to participate in the \"reverse showrooming\" phenomena. Businesses in group one are already there.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">The Internet has been a disruptive force over the past two decades. New business models like search engines and social networks have emerged while other business models like traditional media and home telephone service have been challenged. Mobile devices are simply the next evolution in the cultural shift away from being tethered.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Jason Holmes is the general manager of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.advocatedigitalmedia.com/\" style=\"color: #0000ee;\" target=\"_blank\">Advocate Digital Media</a>, a sister company to The Victoria Advocate that focuses on digital marketing.

More than a year ago, Google termed responsive design a \"best practice.\" Now, it appears that not following that cue will begin to materially effect search engine results.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">While Google is often accused of being heavy handed when it comes to the search engine's mysterious algorithms and unwritten rules, the company has been very active in giving back to the development community through Google's webmaster tools.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">A quick visit to Google's Web fundamentals resource can get you well on your way to building a multidevice responsively designed site for your business.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Even if you're not the type to actually build your own site, I would recommend having a look around Web fundamentals if only to better understand what your contractor or agency is building for your business.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">If you know you want to move forward with a responsively designed multidevice website, make sure you're dealing with someone who knows what they're doing. Many times, local business owners entrust their Web presence to friends, kids of friends, nephews or other folks they say \"know computers\" or \"get that stuff,\" when in reality they're just hobbyists or have no idea how to position a business on the Internet in a way that gets real results.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">If you entrust your 24-hour digital presence to someone, treat that decision the same way you would treat any other business decision, such as selecting a supplier or critical vendor.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Ask for references, certifications and logic behind the proposal.

IPhones, Android devices, Kindles and all other mobile platforms will be affected.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">As Google continues to curate search results, there is no doubt that sites that support multiple platforms and provide a consistent user experience across all devices will be favored. More than a year ago, Google termed responsive design a \"best practice.\" Now, it appears that not following that cue will begin to materially effect search engine results.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">While Google is often accused of being heavy handed when it comes to the search engine's mysterious algorithms and unwritten rules, the company has been very active in giving back to the development community through Google's webmaster tools.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">A quick visit to Google's Web fundamentals resource can get you well on your way to building a multidevice responsively designed site for your business.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Even if you're not the type to actually build your own site, I would recommend having a look around Web fundamentals if only to better understand what your contractor or agency is building for your business.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">If you know you want to move forward with a responsively designed multidevice website, make sure you're dealing with someone who knows what they're doing. Many times, local business owners entrust their Web presence to friends, kids of friends, nephews or other folks they say \"know computers\" or \"get that stuff,\" when in reality they're just hobbyists or have no idea how to position a business on the Internet in a way that gets real results.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">If you entrust your 24-hour digital presence to someone, treat that decision the same way you would treat any other business decision, such as selecting a supplier or critical vendor.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Ask for references, certifications and logic behind the proposal. Do they practice what they preach and have a responsive design website of their own? Have they worked with companies in your industry or similar fields?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">I've urged you to make 2014 the year of responsive design for your site, but let's do it right the first time.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Jason Holmes is the general manager of Advocate Digital Media, a sister company to the Victoria Advocate that focuses on digital marketing.

Evaluate your competition from the viewpoint of a consumer online. If you are competing with national companies or large, regional players, it may seem daunting to take that fight online.

Find local digital marketing experts and ask them tough questions, especially if they're asking you to spend money on them. There are no dumb questions in the realm of digital advertising, and you should only spend money on products that you understand.

If I want a full experience, then I have to choose to \"view full site\" at the bottom of the page. This was the best approach for years. However, with larger mobile phone devices like the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 coming on the scene, the mobile site approach becomes less reliable.

Responsive design: Responsive Web design is an approach that resizes the core site based on the screen size of the visitor.

Think about all of those people around you in traffic, in restaurants, in stores - your store - spending time and attention on their phones and tablets.

            "rss_body": "<p>You see the same phenomenon all around you.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>Children, teenagers, young adults, parents and even grandparents are all on their phones almost all the time. They're texting, browsing, playing, shopping, texting some more, checking email, checking in on Facebook, downloading music, tweeting, reading news and sharing photos and videos. They're doing everything except actually speaking on the phone.</p>\n<p>Our society has become hypermobile. Next time you're stopped at a light, take a moment and look at the cars around you. Chances are you'll see more than one person on their phones. Mobile use in the vehicle is a serious safety concern, for sure, but that's not the jurisdiction of this column. Let's discuss what mobile means to your business.</p>\n<p>When it comes to your mobile Web presence, there are two primary approaches:</p>\n<p>1. Mobile website: This is the approach that you see most often - sites that are specifically designed to display properly on mobile devices. When a website uses mobile website design, the Web server detects the user's device and chooses which website to display. For instance, when I visit foxnews.com on my iPhone, the server automatically redirects my device to foxnews.mobi. If I want a full experience, then I have to choose to \"view full site\" at the bottom of the page. This was the best approach for years. However, with larger mobile phone devices like the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 coming on the scene, the mobile site approach becomes less reliable. These devices aren't like smaller smartphones but aren't quite tablets either. In order to display a usable yet rich experience, designers need to consider the responsive web design approach.</p>\n<p>2. Responsive design: Responsive Web design is an approach that resizes the core site based on the screen size of the visitor. For instance, if I visit your site on my iPhone while another user visits on a tablet or desktop consumer, we all see different versions of the same site. The details are technical for non-website developers, but the beauty of responsive design is in its adaptive nature and single URL structure.</p>\n<p>If you, as a mobile device user, share a URL from a responsive site with friends on Facebook or through email, then it doesn't matter what device your friends are using. The URLs are the same on a desktop computer, tablet or smartphone.</p>\n<p>There are no m.website.com or website.mobi URL structures to deal with and far less maintenance required once the responsive design is implemented versus redundant updates that need to be made on separate mobile and desktop iterations.</p>\n<p>For these reasons and several others, Google has declared that responsive web design is an \"industry best practice.\" For this reason alone, business owners should consider responsive web design.</p>\n<p>So beyond Google's declaration, why should you, as a small or medium business owner concern yourself with a mobile strategy? Think about all of those people around you in traffic, in restaurants, in stores - your store - spending time and attention on their phones and tablets. If you've invested heavily in your website and Internet presence but haven't considered your mobile audience, it's time to do so. Reminds me of the saying, \"Culture destroys strategy.\" Our culture is mobile.</p>",
